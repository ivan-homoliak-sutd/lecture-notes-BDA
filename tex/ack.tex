First, I would like to thank the authors of existing blockchain courses upon which the course "Blockchains and Decentralized Applications" was built at the time of its creation. In particular, acknowledgments are due to Pawel Szalachowski from the Singapore University of Technology and Design, Andrew Miller and Elaine Shi from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and Joseph Bonneau from New York University.
Second, I would like to thank the course coordinator, Vladimir Vesely, for preparing and presenting lectures related to Bitcoin, as well as for enriching the course with a practically oriented invited talk on blockchain forensics.
Next, I would like to thank the teaching assistants -- Martin Peresini, Samuel Oleksak, and Ivana Stancikova -- who contributed invaluably to this course, whether by preparing and presenting certain topics or by assisting with assignments and demos.
Finally, I would like to thank the AI tools that assisted with the style and grammar of these lecture notes.
I declare that no dedicated funding was received for creating these lecture notes or the course itself; it was developed purely out of the interest and dedication of the guarantor and all those mentioned above.
