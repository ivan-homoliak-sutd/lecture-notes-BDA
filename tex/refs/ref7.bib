I examine six intertwined dynamics that pertain to the rise of computational politics: the rise of big data, the shift away from demographics to individualized targeting, the opacity and power of computational modeling, the use of persuasive behavioral science, digital media enabling dynamic real-time experimentation, and the growth of new power brokers who own the data or social media environments. I then examine the consequences of these new mechanisms on the public sphere and political campaigns.},

abstract="This paper presents MarkPledge3 (MP3), the most efficient specification of the MarkPledge (MP) technique. The MP technique allows the voter to verify that her vote is correctly encrypted with a soundness of 1{\thinspace}−{\thinspace}2−{\thinspace}$\alpha$, with 20{\thinspace}≤{\thinspace}$\alpha${\thinspace}≤{\thinspace}30, just by performing a match of a small string (4-5 characters). Due to its simplicity, verifying the election public data (vote encryptions and tally) in MP3 is 2.6 times faster than with MP2 and the vote encryption creation on devices with low computational power, e.g. smart cards, is approximately 6 times better than the best of the previous MP specifications (MP1 and MP2).",

An encryption scheme is deniable if the sender can generate 'fake random choices' that will make the ciphertext `look like' an encryption of a different cleartext, thus keeping the real cleartext private. Analogous requirements can be formulated with respect to attacking the receiver and with respect to attacking both parties.",

title="How to Leak a Secret",
booktitle="ASIACRYPT 2001",

publisher="Springer Berlin Heidelberg",

pages="552--565",
abstract="In this paper we formalize the notion of a ring signature, which makes it possible to specify a set of possible signers without revealing which member actually produced the signature.Unlike group signatures, ring signatures have no group managers, no setup procedures, no revocation procedures, and no coordination:any user can choose any set of possible signers that includes himself,and sign any message by using his secret key and the others' public keys,without getting their approval or assistance. Ring signatures provide an elegant way to leak authoritativ secrets in an anonymous way, to sign casual email in a way which can only be verified by its intended recipient, and to solve other problems in multiparty computations. The main contribution of this paper is a new construction of such signatures which is unconditionally signer-ambiguous, provably secure in the random oracle model,and exceptionally efficient:adding each ring member increases the cost of signing or verifying by a single modular multiplication and a single symmetric encryption.",

The length is irrelevant to the number of MIXes ( control centers ). It improves the efficiency of Chaum's election scheme based on the MIX net automatically. Second, we show an election scheme which satisfies fairness. That is, if some vote is disrupted, no one obtains any information about all the other votes. Each voter sends O(nk) bits so that the probability of the fairness is 1 − 2−k, where n is the bit length of the ciphertext.",

abstract="We present a receipt-free voting scheme based on a mix- type anonymous channel [Cha81, PIK93]. The receipt-freeness property [BT94] enables voters to hide how they have voted even from a powerful adversary who is trying to coerce him. The work of [BT94] gave the first solution using a voting booth, which is a hardware assumption not unlike that in current physical elections. In our proposed scheme, we reduce the physical assumptions required to obtain receipt-freeness. Our sole physical assumption is the existence of a private channel through which the center can send the voter a message without fear of eavesdropping.",

The other scheme does not require the help of the commission, but needs a stronger physical assumption, the existence of a voting booth.

abstract="Strong voter privacy, although an important property of an election scheme, is usually compromised in election protocol design in favor of other (desirable) properties. In this work we introduce a new election paradigm with strong voter privacy as its primary objective. Our paradigm is built around three useful properties of voting schemes we define: (1) Perfect Ballot Secrecy, ensures that knowledge about the partial tally of the ballots of any set of voters is only computable by the coalition of all the remaining voters (this property captures strong voter privacy as understood in real world elections). (2) Self-tallying, suggests that the post-ballot-casting phase is an open procedure that can be performed by any interested (casual) third party. Finally, (3) Dispute-freeness, suggests that disputes between active parties are prevented altogether, which is an important efficient integrity component.",

The information rate of the scheme is 1/2 and the distribution as well as the verification requires approximately 2k modular multiplications pr. bit of the secret.
